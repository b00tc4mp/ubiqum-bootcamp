  <h2>General Information</h2>
  <dl>
      The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 
      to provide athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhoods
      an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL,
      you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood.
      NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer
      time of parents and previous members.
