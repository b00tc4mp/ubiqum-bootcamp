    <h1>Senators</h1>
    <p>
      First convened in 1789, the composition and powers of the Senate are established 
      in Article One of the U.S. Constitution. Each state is represented by two senators, 
      regardless of population, who serve staggered six-year terms. The Senate has 
      several exclusive powers not granted to the House, including consenting to 
      treaties as a precondition to their ratification and consenting to or confirming 
      appointments of Cabinet secretaries, federal judges, other federal executive 
      officials, military officers, regulatory officials, ambassadors, and other federal 
      uniformed officers, as well as trial of federal officials impeached by the House.
