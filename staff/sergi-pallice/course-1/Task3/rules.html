        <h3><i>We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</i></h3>
        <dl>
            Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using superior safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials. Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA Official.
            Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the best protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.
            National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two additional Safety Levels.

            <dl>It is highly recommended that all convertible vehicles be equipped with an aftermarket roll bar that meets or exceeds the standards set in the Time Trials Safety Standard Level 2 (see below). However, minimum safety standards requires the vehicle meets at least one of the following criteria and is not subject to any of the listed exceptions:</dl>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Convertible vehicles up to and including the 2005 model year</b> must have rollover protection meeting one of the following criteria:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>The vehicle is equipped with documented factory installed roll over protection. (Examples of manufacturer-documented roll over protection include hydroformed and reinforced a-pillars or windshield frame and factory installed roll bars and/or “pop-up” bars that are designated as roll over protection.)</li>
                <li>The vehicle is equipped with a commercially produced roll bar or roll cage which is described by the manufacturer to provide track-appropriate rollover protection. (E.g., “style” bars are not acceptable.)</li>
                <li>The vehicle is equipped with a roll bar that meets the Safety Level 2 standards for material and construction.</li>
              </ol>

                <dl><b>Note:</b> This means that for 2006+ vehicles, if the engine is not the original equipment model as delivered in that vehicle,  aftermarket forced induction has been installed, or the vehicle has more than six (6) cylinders or six (6) cylinders and forced induction of any type, the vehicle must have aftermarket rollover protection or documented factory rollover protection.</dl>

            <dl>Safety Level 2 generally means a 4-point roll bar, 5-point racing harness, arm restraints or window net, and fire-retardant helmets and clothing.</dl>
            <dl>For Time Trials Nationals Events, vehicles running on DOT-approved tires with less than 200 treadwear or beyond Max Category Rules must meet Safety Level 2 Standards. Vehicles with modified or aftermarket fuel tanks and lines which run through the cockpit will need to meet Safety Level 2 Standards for driver clothing.</dl>
            <dl>All vehicles required to meet Safety Level 2 Standards must meet the Safety Level 1 Standards, plus the additions below.</dl>
