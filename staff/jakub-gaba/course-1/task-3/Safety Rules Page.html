        <h1><b>TIME TRIALS SAFETY RULES</b></h1>
        <div class="container_safety_subtext">We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</div>
        <p class="safety_text">Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against
            injury or death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using
            superior
            safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials. Drivers are
            responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation under elevated
            acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed
            and available to present to an SCCA Official.
            <br><br>
            Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the
            best protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint systems, roll
            bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.
            <br><br>
            National Time Trials Events and some
            SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two
            additional Safety Levels.

                For Time Trials Nationals Events, vehicles running on DOT-approved tires with less than 200 treadwear or
                beyond Max Category Rules must meet Safety Level 2 Standards. Vehicles with modified or aftermarket fuel
                tanks and lines which run through the cockpit will need to meet Safety Level 2 Standards for driver
                clothing.
                <br><br>
                All vehicles required to meet Safety Level 2 Standards must meet the Safety Level 1 Standards, plus the

                    <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The roll bar hoop and all braces must be of
                        seamless or DOM mild steel
                        tubing (SAE 1010, 1020,
                        1025) or equivalent, or alloy steel tubing (SAE 4130). For cars logbooked before 1/1/16,
                        existing ERW tubing is acceptable.</li>
                    <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">All welding should be of the highest
                        possible quality with full
                        penetration. Craters should be filled to the cross section of the weld and undercut be no more
                        than 0.01 inch deep.</li>
                    <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">All roll bars must be braced in a manner to
                        prevent movement in a
                        fore-and-aft direction with the braces attached within the top third of the roll hoop. At a
                        minimum, two (2) braces must be used, parallel to the sides of the car, and placed at the outer
                        extremities of the roll bar hoop. Such braces should extend to the rear whenever possible.
                        Diagonal lateral bracing must be installed to prevent lateral distortion of the hoop. In most
                        cases, a lateral brace from the bottom corner of the hoop on the side to the top corner of the
                        hoop on the other side is sufficient. Although installing the diagonal lateral brace in the main
                        hoop is the strongest alternative (and hence most preferable), there may be instances where such
                        an installation is not practical. In such situations, the installation of the diagonal brace
                        running from the bottom of the fore/aft brace on one side to the top corner of the hoop on the
                        other side is acceptable. In convertible vehicles with a production line beginning 1990 or
                        later, such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design, also known as a “double diagonal” used between the
                        rear supports is acceptable.</li>
                    <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Removable roll bars and braces must be very
                        carefully designed and
                        constructed to be at least as strong as a permanent installation. If one (1) tube fits inside
                        another tube to facilitate removal, the removable portion must fit tightly and must bottom on
                        the permanent mounting, and at least two (2) bolts must be used to secure each telescope
                        section. The telescope section must be at least eight inches in length. One (1) bolt is required
                        if one (1) end is welded to the main hoop.</li>
                    <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Roll bars and braces must be attached to
                        the frame of the car wherever
                        possible. Mounting plates may be used for this purpose where desired.</li>
                    <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">In the case of cars with unitized or
                        frameless construction, mounting
                        plates may be used to secure the roll bar structure to the car floor. The important
                        consideration is that the load be distributed over as large an area as possible. A backing plate
                        of equal size and thickness must be used on the opposite side of the panel with the plates
                        through-bolted together.</li>
                    <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Mounting plates bolted to the structure
                        shall not be less than 0.1875
                        inch thick and the use of a back-up plate of equal size and thickness on the opposite side of
                        the panel with the plates through-bolted together is recommended. A minimum of three (3) bolts
                        per plate is required for bolted mounting plates.</li>
                    <li class="car_text__long" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Mounting plates welded to the structure
                        shall not be less than 0.080 inch
                        thick. Whenever possible, the mounting plate should extend onto a vertical section of the
                        structure, such as a door pillar.</li>

                <li>Seats</li>
                <p class="safety_text" style="line-height: 30px;">It is highly recommended that the driver’s seat be
                    replaced with a one-piece, bucket-type race seat. If used, the one-piece, bucket-type race seat
                    shall be securely mounted and provide fore/aft and lateral support.

                SCCA Road Racing. Vehicles of motorsports-specific construction are required to meet these
                specifications. For National Time Trial Events, vehicles prepared beyond Max Category Rules and
                competing on tires without DOT-Approval must meet Safety Level 3 Standards.
                <br><br>
                All Safety Level 3 vehicles must meet the requirements of Safety Levels 1 and 2, plus the inclusion of a
                roll cage compliant with specifications listed here. A roll cage consists of the main hoop, front hoop,
                side protection, and braces as specified in these Rules.
                <br><br>
                These specifications apply to all vehicles other than those issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19. Cars
                issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19 may continue to compete with their previously approved rollover
                structure or comply with the following specifications.
