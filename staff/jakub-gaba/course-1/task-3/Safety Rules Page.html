        <h1><b>TIME TRIALS SAFETY RULES</b></h1>
        <div class="container_safety_subtext">We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</div>
        <p class="safety_text">Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against
            injury or death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using
            superior
            safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials. Drivers are
            responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation under elevated
            acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed
            and available to present to an SCCA Official.
            <br><br>
            Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the
            best protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint systems, roll
            bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.
            <br><br>
            National Time Trials Events and some
            SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two
            additional Safety Levels.
